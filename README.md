# find-a-mentor-ios
Welcome to the brand new project for the Find A Mentor App.
To develop this app we decided to go Native.


## Tooling
To work on the app you will need to install a couple of tools:
1. [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen): this tool generates the project starting from a `yml` file. This is really useful to avoid to push to the repo all the xcode projects files that usually leads to conflicts.
2. [Cocoapods](org.cocoapods): This is the dependency manager we decided to use for the development of the app.

## Setup
To set up the project on you machine, follow these steps:

1. clone this repository
2. navigate into the repo folder
3. run the `sh make_project.sh` script

This script will create the project files, install the dependencies and open the workspace file.

The Xcode IDE should appear on the screen.

## How to contribute
1. Follow the setup process above.
2. Create a new branch in your local repository
3. Push your code in your branche
4. create a PR and ask for someone to review your code.

**Never push directly to the master branch! Thank you!**
